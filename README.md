# Equipt Monorepo

This repository houses both the web client and backend API for Equipt.

- `Equipt/`: Vue 3 application that powers the user-facing experience. It is scaffolded with Vite and contains all frontend assets, components, and tooling.
- `equipment/`: Node.js (Express) backend service that communicates with Supabase and other third-party APIs for storage/auth/data access.

Each folder has its own README with setup steps, scripts, and architecture notes. Please navigate into the respective directory (`Equipt/README.md` or `equipment/README.md`) for detailed instructions on running, testing, and deploying that part of the stack.
